# Go-Is-A-Joke
A simple web server which generates jokes based on the user's choices with the help of an external API. The server is made without using any frameworks ( using net/http base package built over the net/tcp package ). Use of templates , io , fmt and log packages have also been used to create a user interface where user can request the type of joke they 
want to listen based on the various categories , blacklistFlags, etc. The Full Joke API documentation link is given below :
